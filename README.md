### quoridor-hs

An implementation in Haskell of the 2-player strategy game

Work-in-progress.

# TODO
- Features
    - Online multiplayer
    - Competent AI
    - A CLI interface
    - A web application
- Bugs
    - Will have to move to a method where you calculate valid positions
      instead of getting a position and checking if it's valid.
      It will fix some edge cases.

# Issues
- Can't see errors with hdevtools when editing quoridor.hs the main file.
  Started after adding a test-suite to the cabal file
